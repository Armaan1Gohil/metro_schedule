# Metro Train Schedule Graph App

Welcome to the Metro Train Schedule Graph App, a Python-based application developed using Dash by Plotly, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy. This app allows you to visualize train schedules with station chainage and travel times, customize headway and dwell time settings, and generate dynamic graphs for different scenarios.

Application is hosted for free, hence takes time to load.

## Features

- Visualizes the train schedule with station chainage and travel times.
- Customizable headway and dwell time settings.
- Dynamic graph generation for different scenarios.

## Why I Built It

Traction simulation reports often begin with the train schedule. This free application serves as the initial step towards automating various calculations in accordance with IEEE and EN standards. It lays the foundation for more comprehensive automated analysis, reducing reliance on expensive software tools.
